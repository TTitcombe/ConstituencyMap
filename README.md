# ConstituencyMap
This project contains code to generate maps of the United Kingdom divided by constituency lines. One can supply constituency-level data, 
such as number of voters, to see the constituency break down of the data.

Formally known as choropleth maps, the plots are generated using geopandas.

## How to use
Clone the repo and run the python script or ipython script in the `map` directory.

The plots use the generalised parliamentary boundaries as of December 2015 by default (error downloading more recent data - update on the way). To use different geographic divisions,
download the [*shapefile*](https://www.gislounge.com/what-is-a-shapefile/) you want and replace the dataset loaded in the example.

You can download official UK boundaries [here](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?q=Parliamentary%20Generalized%20Clipped%20Boundaries).

_Note: Make sure you copy_ **all** _of the files, not just the shp file._

### What are constituencies?
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland operates elections under a first-past-the-post (fptp) system.
The nation is split into hundreds of **constituencies** of **roughly** the same number of citizens. 

In General Elections, the politician with the most votes in each constituency is elected as that constituency's representative to the House of Commons,
as one of 650 Members of Parliament (MP).
