# ConstituencyMap
This project contains code to generate maps of the United Kingdom divided by constituency lines. One can supply constituency-level data, 
such as number of voters, to see the constituency break down of the data.

Formally known as choropleth maps, the plots are generated using plotly.

### What are constituencies?
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland operates elections under a first-past-the-post (fptp) system.
The nation is split into hundreds of **constituencies** of **roughly** the same number of citizens. 

In General Elections, the politician with the most votes in each constituency is elected as that constituencies representative to the House of Commons.
